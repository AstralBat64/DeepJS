# 1. Virtual layer AI
DeepJS is able to build and run an application depends on the power of AI in general. It can use package shop or restore its core code with pushing new app on top.

# 2. Update layer AI
DeepJS update layer based on nested string code compilation. This service can update the DeepJS application and proceed request-responce client-server communication request in JSON. 
       
    JSON{_{_{nested}, string{}}}

# 3. Deep layer AI
DeepJS core layer service based on simple precompiled calculations from the past AI researches and can fast calculate the data.

    "1. Left hand" : 36
    "2. Right hand" : 24
    "3. Left feet" : 16
    "4. Right feet" : 12
    "5. Tail" : 8 
```
## Vertical sync pattern
DeepJS perfomance can be setted by fixed FPS parameters and primary attributes like : tripple line, line, square, circle and coins
